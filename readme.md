-- Was done as in an interview assessment in a matter of hours; I figure I would keep it for potential employers
- Responsive design (not fully responsive but functional)
- did not use babel
- strictly vanilla javascript -- if I had more time I would encapsulate the api in a node server
- better guarding needed
- would do more semantic markup if time permitted
- both API functions work well.

- Like buttons get disabled for only 3 minutes after an action is taken
- Polling is used..would use a better solution if time permitted
